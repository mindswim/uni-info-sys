## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### Navigation Updates Needed
Update `/frontend/src/components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx` to add:

```typescript
// Additional navigation for different roles
const navigationItems = {
  advisor: [
    {
      title: "Advising",
      items: [
        { title: "My Students", url: "/my-students", icon: Users },

        { title: "Degree Planning", url: "/degree-planning", icon: Target },
        { title: "Early Alerts", url: "/early-alerts", icon: AlertCircle }
      ]
    }
  ],
  registrar: [

## üìù Notes

The system has a good foundation but is missing critical administrative functions. The focus has been on student-facing features, but a real SIS needs robust back-office capabilities. Priority should be on financial systems (so students can pay) and advisor tools (for student success).

All new pages should:
1. Use AppShell for consistent navigation
2. Include role-based access checks
3. Have loading states and error handling
4. Use mock data initially, then connect to API
5. Be mobile responsive
6. Include audit logging

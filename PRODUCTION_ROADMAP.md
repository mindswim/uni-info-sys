- [ ] Add grade submission deadlines to terms
- [ ] Implement grade validation (only enrolled students can receive grades)
- [ ] Add grade change request workflow

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Data Migration:** Legacy data may be incomplete or inconsistent
- **FERPA Compliance:** Student data privacy violations could result in legal issues
- **Performance at Scale:** Current system tested with only 103 students

### Medium Risk
- **User Adoption:** Resistance to change from manual processes
- **Third-party Integrations:** Payment processors, email services may have issues

### Low Risk
- **Technical Stack:** Laravel + Next.js are mature, well-supported
- **Infrastructure:** Docker + PostgreSQL proven at scale

---

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a comprehensive path from the current MVP state to a production-ready SIS platform. The phased approach allows for incremental delivery of value while maintaining system stability.

**Next Immediate Actions:**
1. Complete Phase 1.1 (Grade Management) to make current data realistic
2. Implement Phase 1.2 (Course Registration) as it's core to SIS functionality
3. Set up Phase 5.5 (API Performance) infrastructure early

**Quarterly Reviews:**
- Reassess priorities based on user feedback
- Update timeline based on actual velocity
- Add/remove features based on business needs

This document should be updated as requirements evolve and new features are discovered.

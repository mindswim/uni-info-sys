```

**Laravel API Implementation:**
- **Tables**: `users`, `students`, `admission_applications`, `program_choices`, `documents`, `academic_records`
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `POST /api/v1/admission-applications` - Create application
  - `POST /api/v1/admission-applications/{id}/program-choices` - Add program preferences
  - `POST /api/v1/students/{student}/documents` - Upload documents
  - `POST /api/v1/students/{student}/academic-records` - Add academic history

**Current Data Structure:**
```json
// admission_applications table
{
  "id": 1,
  "student_id": 1,
  "term_id": 1,
  "status": "accepted|pending|rejected",
  "application_date": "2025-03-25 00:58:40",
  "decision_date": null,
  "decision_status": null,
  "comments": null
}
```

**Key Steps:**
1. **Application Creation**

  "start_time": "10:00:00",
  "end_time": "11:00:00"
}
```

**Organizational Structure:**
```
Faculties (3) → Departments → Programs → Courses (12) → Course Sections (50)
```

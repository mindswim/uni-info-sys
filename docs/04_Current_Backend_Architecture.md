## 1. Executive Summary

### What This System Is
The University Admissions backend is a comprehensive RESTful API built with Laravel 11 that manages the complete lifecycle of university operations - from student admissions to course enrollment and academic management. It serves as the data and business logic layer for a modern university management system.

### Key Capabilities
- **Student Management**: Complete student profiles, academic records, and application tracking
- **Academic Structure**: Full university hierarchy (Faculties → Departments → Programs → Courses)
- **Course Management**: Course catalog, sections, scheduling, and enrollment
- **Staff Management**: Faculty and administrative staff with role-based permissions
- **Infrastructure**: Physical campus management (buildings, rooms, scheduling)

## 2. System Architecture Overview

### Architectural Patterns

The system follows a layered architecture with clear separation of responsibilities:

    M --> L
```

### Request Lifecycle

Here's how a complex API request (student enrollment) flows through the system:

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant Router as Routes (api.php)
    participant Auth as Auth Middleware
    participant Controller as EnrollmentController
    participant FormRequest as StoreEnrollmentRequest
    participant Service as Business Logic
    participant Model as Eloquent Models
    participant Notifier as Notification System
    participant Resource as EnrollmentResource

    Client->>+Router: POST /api/v1/enrollments
    Note over Client,Router: Bearer Token in Header
    
    Router->>+Auth: Validate Token
    Auth-->>-Router: User Authenticated
    
    Router->>+Controller: store(StoreEnrollmentRequest)
    Controller->>+FormRequest: Auto-resolve & Validate
    
    alt Validation Fails
        FormRequest-->>Controller: 422 Validation Error
        Controller-->>Client: JSON Error Response
    else Validation Passes
        FormRequest-->>-Controller: Validated Data
        
        Controller->>+Service: Check Capacity & Business Rules
        Service->>+Model: Query Course Section
        Model-->>-Service: Section Data
        
        alt Course Full
            Service->>Model: Create with status='waitlisted'
        else Space Available
            Service->>Model: Create with status='enrolled'
        end
        
        Model-->>-Service: New Enrollment
        Service->>+Notifier: Send Status Notification
        Notifier-->>-Service: Notification Queued
        Service-->>-Controller: Enrollment Object
        
        Controller->>+Resource: Transform to JSON
        Resource-->>-Controller: Formatted Response
        Controller-->>-Client: 201 Created + JSON Data
    end
```

### Key Model Relationships Explained

**User-Centric Design**: The `User` model serves as the authentication hub, with `Student` and `Staff` models extending user capabilities through one-to-one relationships.

**Academic Hierarchy**: `Faculty` → `Department` → `Program`/`Course` creates a logical academic structure that mirrors real university organization.

**Course Scheduling**: `Course` (catalog) → `CourseSection` (specific offering) → `Enrollment` (student registration) enables flexible scheduling and capacity management.

**Physical Infrastructure**: `Building` → `Room` → `CourseSection` links academic scheduling with physical space management.

## 4. Authentication & Authorization

### Token-Based Authentication (Laravel Sanctum)

The system uses Laravel Sanctum for stateless API authentication:

```php
// AuthController@login - Token Creation
public function login(Request $request)
{
    $request->validate([
        'email' => 'required|email',
        'password' => 'required',
        'device_name' => 'required',
    ]);

    $user = User::where('email', $request->email)->first();

    if (! $user || ! Hash::check($request->password, $user->password)) {
        throw ValidationException::withMessages([
            'email' => ['The provided credentials are not correct.'],
        ]);
    }

    return response()->json([
        'token' => $user->createToken($request->device_name)->plainTextToken
    ]);
}
```

### Authentication Flow

1. **Token Creation**: `POST /api/v1/tokens/create` with email/password/device_name
2. **Token Usage**: Include `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header in all API requests
3. **Token Validation**: `auth:sanctum` middleware validates tokens automatically
4. **User Context**: `$request->user()` provides authenticated user in controllers

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system implements a flexible RBAC system:

**Models**:
- `Role`: Defines user roles (admin, student, faculty, staff)
- `Permission`: Defines specific permissions (view-applications, edit-courses)
- `User`: Links to roles via many-to-many relationship

**Usage Example**:
```php
// Check if user has specific permission
if ($user->hasPermissionTo('edit-applications')) {
    // Allow action
}

// Check if user has role
if ($user->hasRole('admin')) {
    // Admin-only functionality
}
```

## 6. Core Business Logic

### Student Enrollment System

The enrollment system is the most complex business logic component, handling course capacity, waitlists, and status transitions.

#### Enrollment Process Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Student Requests Enrollment] --> B[Validate Student & Course Section]
    B --> C{Course Section Full?}
    C -->|No| D[Enroll with status='enrolled']
    C -->|Yes| E[Enroll with status='waitlisted']
    D --> F[Send Enrollment Confirmation]
    E --> G[Send Waitlist Notification]
    F --> H[Update Course Section Count]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Return Success Response]
    
    J[Student Withdraws] --> K{Was Student Enrolled?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Update Status to 'withdrawn']
    K -->|No| M[Update Status to 'withdrawn']
    L --> N[Check Waitlist for Promotion]
    M --> O[Return Success]
    N --> P{Waitlisted Students Exist?}
    P -->|Yes| Q[Promote First Waitlisted Student]
    P -->|No| O
    Q --> R[Send Promotion Notification]
    R --> O
```

#### Key Business Rules

**Capacity Management**:
```php
// From StoreEnrollmentRequest validation
public function withValidator($validator)
{
    $validator->after(function ($validator) {
        $courseSection = CourseSection::find($this->course_section_id);
        $enrolledCount = $courseSection->enrollments()
            ->where('status', 'enrolled')->count();
        
        if ($enrolledCount >= $courseSection->capacity) {
            // Will be waitlisted
            $this->merge(['status' => 'waitlisted']);
        } else {
            $this->merge(['status' => 'enrolled']);
        }
    });
}
```

**Waitlist Promotion**:
```php
// From EnrollmentController
private function promoteFromWaitlist(CourseSection $courseSection): void
{
    $enrolledCount = $courseSection->enrollments()
        ->where('status', 'enrolled')->count();
    
    if ($enrolledCount < $courseSection->capacity) {
        $waitlistedEnrollment = $courseSection->enrollments()
            ->where('status', 'waitlisted')
            ->orderBy('created_at')
            ->first();
        
        if ($waitlistedEnrollment) {
            $waitlistedEnrollment->update(['status' => 'enrolled']);
            // Send notification to promoted student
        }
    }
}
```

### Application Status Management

The `AdmissionService` handles application lifecycle and notifications:

```php
public function updateApplicationStatus(AdmissionApplication $application, string $newStatus): AdmissionApplication
{
    $oldStatus = $application->status;
    
    // Update the application status
    $application->update(['status' => $newStatus]);
    
    // Only send notification if status actually changed
    if ($oldStatus !== $newStatus) {
        // Dispatch notification to the student's user
        $application->student->user->notify(new ApplicationStatusUpdated($application));
        
        Log::info("Application {$application->id} status updated from {$oldStatus} to {$newStatus}. Notification sent to user {$application->student->user->id}.");
    }
    
    return $application;
}
```

## 7. JSON Transformation Layer

### API Resources Overview

API Resources provide a transformation layer between Eloquent models and JSON responses, ensuring consistent output and preventing data leakage.

### Example: EnrollmentResource

**Raw Eloquent Model** (what we DON'T want to expose):
```php
Enrollment {
  id: 1,
  student_id: 5,
  course_section_id: 12,
  status: "enrolled",
  grade: null,
  created_at: "2024-01-15 10:30:00",
  updated_at: "2024-01-15 10:30:00",
  // Raw foreign key IDs, timestamps, etc.
}
```

**Transformed API Response** (clean, structured JSON):
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "status": "enrolled",
    "grade": null,
    "enrolled_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "student": {
      "id": 5,
      "student_number": "STU001",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@university.edu"
    },
    "course_section": {
      "id": 12,
      "section_number": "001",
      "capacity": 30,
      "enrolled_count": 25,
      "available_spots": 5,
      "schedule_display": "MWF 9:00 AM-10:00 AM",

        "credits": 3
      },
      "term": {

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Resource Features

**Conditional Loading**: Resources only include relationships when they're explicitly loaded:
```php
'student' => $this->whenLoaded('student', function () {
    return [
        'id' => $this->student->id,
        'student_number' => $this->student->student_number,
        'name' => $this->student->first_name . ' ' . $this->student->last_name,
    ];
})
```

**Computed Fields**: Resources can add calculated values:
```php
'available_spots' => max(0, $courseSection->capacity - $enrolledCount),
'schedule_display' => $this->formatScheduleDisplay($courseSection)
```

**Data Protection**: Sensitive fields are never accidentally exposed since only explicitly defined fields are included.

## 8. Error Handling & Validation

### Centralized Error Handling

All API errors return consistent JSON responses via `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
$exceptions->render(function (Throwable $e, Illuminate\Http\Request $request) {
    if ($request->is('api/*')) {
        $message = 'An unexpected error occurred.';
        $statusCode = 500;
        $errors = [];

        if ($e instanceof Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\NotFoundHttpException) {
            $message = 'The requested resource was not found.';
            $statusCode = 404;
        } elseif ($e instanceof Illuminate\Auth\AuthenticationException) {
            $message = 'Unauthenticated.';
            $statusCode = 401;
        } elseif ($e instanceof Illuminate\Auth\Access\AuthorizationException) {
            $message = 'This action is unauthorized.';
            $statusCode = 403;
        } elseif ($e instanceof Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException) {
            $message = 'The given data was invalid.';
            $statusCode = 422;
            $errors = $e->errors();
        }

        $response = ['message' => $message];
        if (!empty($errors)) {
            $response['errors'] = $errors;
        }

        return response()->json($response, $statusCode);
    }
});
```

### Standard Error Responses

**404 Not Found**:
```json
{
  "message": "The requested resource was not found."
}
```

**401 Unauthenticated**:
```json
{
  "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
```

**422 Validation Error**:
```json
{
  "message": "The given data was invalid.",
  "errors": {
    "email": ["The email field is required."],
    "course_section_id": ["The selected course section is invalid."]
  }
}
```

### Form Request Validation

Validation logic is centralized in Form Request classes:

```php
// StoreEnrollmentRequest
public function rules(): array
{
    return [
        'student_id' => 'required|exists:students,id',
        'course_section_id' => 'required|exists:course_sections,id',
    ];
}

public function withValidator($validator)
{
    $validator->after(function ($validator) {
        // Custom business logic validation
        if ($this->duplicateEnrollmentExists()) {
            $validator->errors()->add('course_section_id', 
                'Student is already enrolled in this course section.');
        }
    });
}
```

## 9. Notification System

### Database-Driven Notifications

The system uses Laravel's notification system with database storage for persistent, queryable notifications.

### Notification Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin
    participant Service as AdmissionService
    participant Model as AdmissionApplication
    participant Notification as ApplicationStatusUpdated
    participant Database
    participant Student
    participant API as NotificationController

    Admin->>Service: updateApplicationStatus(app, 'accepted')
    Service->>Model: Update status
    Model-->>Service: Updated application
    Service->>Notification: new ApplicationStatusUpdated(app)
    Notification->>Database: Store notification record
    Service-->>Admin: Success response
    
    Student->>API: GET /api/v1/notifications
    API->>Database: Query unread notifications
    Database-->>API: Notification records
    API-->>Student: JSON response with notifications
    
    Student->>API: POST /api/v1/notifications/{id}/read
    API->>Database: Update read_at timestamp
    API-->>Student: 204 No Content
```

### Notification Structure

**ApplicationStatusUpdated Notification**:
```php
public function toDatabase($notifiable): array
{
    return [
        'application_id' => $this->application->id,
        'status' => $this->application->status,
        'message' => "Your application status has been updated to: {$this->application->status}",
    ];
}
```

**Database Record**:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-string",
  "type": "App\\Notifications\\ApplicationStatusUpdated",
  "notifiable_type": "App\\Models\\User",
  "notifiable_id": 5,
  "data": {
    "application_id": 12,
    "status": "accepted",
    "message": "Your application status has been updated to: accepted"
  },
  "read_at": null,
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## 10. Testing Strategy

### Feature Test Coverage

The system emphasizes comprehensive feature tests that verify complete API workflows:

**Test Categories**:
- **Authentication Tests**: Token creation, validation, error handling
- **CRUD Tests**: Create, read, update, delete operations for all resources
- **Business Logic Tests**: Enrollment capacity, waitlist promotion, status transitions
- **Authorization Tests**: Role-based access control, data isolation
- **Error Handling Tests**: Validation errors, not found, unauthorized access

### Example Test Structure

```php
// tests/Feature/Api/V1/EnrollmentApiTest.php
class EnrollmentApiTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    public function test_can_enroll_student_with_available_capacity()
    {
        $student = Student::factory()->create();
        $courseSection = CourseSection::factory()->create(['capacity' => 30]);
        
        $response = $this->actingAs($student->user, 'sanctum')
            ->postJson('/api/v1/enrollments', [
                'student_id' => $student->id,
                'course_section_id' => $courseSection->id,
            ]);

        $response->assertStatus(201)
            ->assertJson([
                'message' => 'Student has been successfully enrolled in the course section.',
                'data' => [
                    'status' => 'enrolled',
                    'student' => ['id' => $student->id],
                    'course_section' => ['id' => $courseSection->id]
                ]
            ]);

        $this->assertDatabaseHas('enrollments', [
            'student_id' => $student->id,
            'course_section_id' => $courseSection->id,
            'status' => 'enrolled'
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Test Database Management

Tests use SQLite in-memory database with `RefreshDatabase` trait for fast, isolated test execution.

## 13. Performance & Scalability

### Current Optimizations

**Database Optimizations**:
- Proper indexing on foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- Eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
- Pagination on all list endpoints

**API Optimizations**:
- Conditional relationship loading in API Resources
- Efficient filtering with database-level WHERE clauses
- Standardized pagination with metadata

### Recommended Enhancements

**Caching Strategy**:
```php
// Example: Cache faculty list (rarely changes)
$faculties = Cache::remember('faculties.all', 3600, function () {
    return Faculty::with('departments')->get();
});
```

**Database Indexing**:
```sql
-- Recommended additional indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_enrollments_status ON enrollments(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_course_sections_term_course ON course_sections(term_id, course_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_notifiable ON notifications(notifiable_type, notifiable_id, read_at);
```

**Queue System**:
```php
// Move notifications to queues for better performance
$application->student->user->notify(new ApplicationStatusUpdated($application));
// Should become:
dispatch(new SendApplicationNotification($application, $newStatus));
```

# üéØ University System Product Roadmap

## Executive Summary
You have 32+ database tables and 100+ API endpoints already built. The problem isn't building more - it's exposing and connecting what exists. Here's your prioritized roadmap.

---

## üìä What You Already Have (Backend Audit)

### Database Tables (32 total)
- ‚úÖ **Core Entities**: students, staff, users, roles, permissions
- ‚úÖ **Academic Structure**: faculties, departments, programs, courses, course_sections
- ‚úÖ **Student Journey**: admission_applications, program_choices, enrollments, academic_records, documents
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure**: buildings, rooms, terms
- ‚úÖ **Supporting**: course_prerequisites, degree_requirements, notifications, audits

### What's Missing in Frontend
- ‚ùå Student detail pages with ALL properties
- ‚ùå Course detail pages with syllabus, prerequisites
- ‚ùå Program requirements view
- ‚ùå Grade entry/management
- ‚ùå Transcript generation
- ‚ùå Physical space management (buildings/rooms)

## üìã Database Enhancements Needed

### Immediate Additions (Phase 1)
```sql
-- Add to courses table
ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN syllabus TEXT;
ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN learning_outcomes JSON;
ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN textbook VARCHAR(255);

-- Add to course_sections table
ALTER TABLE course_sections ADD COLUMN syllabus_url VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE course_sections ADD COLUMN meeting_url VARCHAR(255); -- For online classes

-- Add to students table
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN major_declaration_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN advisor_id INT REFERENCES staff(id);
```

### Future Additions (Phase 2-3)
```sql
-- Create assignments table
CREATE TABLE assignments (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  course_section_id INT,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  due_date DATETIME,
  points INT
);

-- Create grades table
CREATE TABLE student_grades (
  student_id INT,
  assignment_id INT,
  points_earned DECIMAL(5,2),
  submitted_at DATETIME
);
```

## üéØ Quick Wins (Do These TODAY!)

### 1. Student Detail Page (2 hours)
```tsx
// Create /app/students/[id]/page.tsx
// Pull ALL fields from API
// Show enrollments, GPA, documents
```

### 2. Fix Course Catalog Enrollment (1 hour)
```tsx
// Update /app/course-catalog/page.tsx
// Use real API endpoints
// Show success/waitlist messages
```

### 3. Add Syllabus to Courses (30 mins)

## üö´ What NOT to Do

1. **DON'T** build new features from scratch - use existing backend
2. **DON'T** create new database schema - enhance what exists
3. **DON'T** worry about payments/email yet - get core working
4. **DON'T** optimize or refactor - ship working features

---

## üí° Development Strategy

### Day 1-2: Information Architecture
- Create detail pages for all entities
- Show ALL available data
- Make everything clickable/navigable

### Day 3-4: Core Workflows
- Student enrollment flow
- Grade entry flow
- Application review flow

### Day 5-7: Polish & Fill Gaps
- Replace all "Coming Soon"
- Add missing CRUD operations
- Test complete scenarios

## üî• Start HERE (Next 2 Hours)

1. **Create Student Detail Page**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   # Create src/app/students/[id]/page.tsx
   # Copy pattern from enhanced-students page
   # Fetch from API: /api/v1/students/{id}
   ```

2. **Create Course Detail Page**
   ```bash
   # Create src/app/courses/[id]/page.tsx
   # Fetch from API: /api/v1/courses/{id}
   # Include sections, prerequisites
   ```

3. **Test Full Enrollment Flow**
   - Login as student
   - Browse courses
   - Enroll
   - View in "My Courses"

---

## Code Templates

### Student Detail Page Template
```tsx
// src/app/students/[id]/page.tsx
'use client'

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { API_CONFIG } from '@/config/api'

interface Student {
  id: number
  student_number: string
  first_name: string
  last_name: string
  email: string
  program: any
  enrollments: any[]
  gpa: number
  credits_earned: number
  // ... all other fields
}

export default function StudentDetailPage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const [student, setStudent] = useState<Student | null>(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`${API_CONFIG.V1.STUDENTS}/${params.id}?include=enrollments,program,academic_records`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setStudent(data))
  }, [params.id])

  if (!student) return <div>Loading...</div>

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{student.first_name} {student.last_name}</h1>
      {/* Display ALL student data */}
    </div>
  )
}
```
